Sunday Jan 10 2021:

Design staggered and permissioned object access save state
Create Functions to write and load from save state
Create Functions to permission navigators sets and data
Create return to Lobby Function and response in game to require return to lobby to use certain commands
 
 *Note: implementation of canUse modifiers requires complex Fallback/IntentReflector handler structure
        fallback handler dependant of stateVUI and Navigation alerts for user
        to show where they are and what they can say/ actions they can do

Tasks: All finished execpt for refining the entire game state. can finish today or tommorrow. (1/11)
        Also: Modify a yes/no handler for complex optionality (1/11)
        Ontrack Macro Tasks:  
            Fill the commands in for single player (1/12)
            Develop Boss Battle Functionality -- incorporate dodge Functionality? (1/12)
            Develop Robust Muliplayer (1/13)

*LEARN: Consider using Interceptors

Completed state structure for Single Player and Multiplayer session attributes
Completed but have not tested Return to Lobby Yes No Intent Handlers
Consider flushing out a more robust No Intent Handler (details listed on NoIntentHandler already)

Refine Solo play commands to complete for tommorrow

Tuesday Jan 12 2021:

Outlined details for moveset handlers on solo play 
-start considering efficieny techniques to migrate over for multiplay while writing solo play moveset handlers

Consider developing universal tutorial toggle mode to reduce text on tutorial add ons for each handler
-potentially much much easier than creating a seperate mode for a Tutorial. Just have it built in
-prompt user in tutorial text to say turn off tutorial in each tutorial text 
-and also they can always turn it back on when they want 
    -(but this part of text with less frequency to add in to speech using a function to control when to say it just like upsale handler)
-prompt user in tutorial text to say turn off tutorial or on tutorial whenever it is brought up in help handler

Consider Equipment boosts:
    -heal over time after certain number of moves bonus,
    -Flee ratio increase

Created StartNewGameHandler for solo and multi
Modified Yes no intents for StartNewGameHandler

Add StartNewGameHandler to fallback and IntentReflector responses

Wednesday Jan 13 2021:

Decided not to move forward with multiplayer for now
Added persistence adapter
Modified Moblist for multi stage Mobs 
Finished actOnPosition function to return mob details for MoveHandler implementation
Reviewed process for selecting mobs based on old algo and was quite efficent that I am surprise still right now
Testing persistence structure for save attribute states
Started to add ongoingBattle for mid combat with mobs by pushing details onto save state...

Fix saveSessionAttributesHandler, the loadSession one works fine now.. but there is some issues with undefined showing up
could be because the arguments are empty... FIX: set the arguemtns in the function only if they are available otherwise no...
Save Session attribute handler fixed

StartNew game handler does not work, nor does Move forward handler... debug thos


Monday Jan 18 2021:

Updated actOnPosition Function
Updated initateEncounter Function
Modify in Move Handler hardcoded stage1 string to stage variable in reflection of user session data pick

Tuesday Jan 19 2021:

Finished the rough version of moveTurnHandler code:
    -with encounters
    -updating inBattle
    -check if exceed a rung
Acutally might need to separate actOnPosition for initiate encounter and welcoming to new rung speakout

Completed fetchLoot function

Work to finish both combat handlers for attack and defense and then the shop handler.
Consider Refining all the elements completed so far....
Read over all the notes on here and comments on the code.

create the attack and defend handler without items first to ensure basic functionality.
Test the whole game without modifying attack and defense modifiers first. Once complete, 
you go ahead with the addons knowing the functions work properly.

Wednesday Jan 20 2021:

Attack Handler and function complete and crisp. 
Move Handler kind of janky and needs rework. Modularize it similar to Attack handler

created a function to return the gameMode
finished check coins handler
